# Piral base example

- Using only piral-base library you can choice whatever framework for app-shell and remove the react dependence from it.
- Also without any dependencies from the piral-instance.


Done with commands:
- `npm init piral-instance ./app-shell --name app-shell --framework piral-base`
- `npm init pilet`

Remember to publish your pilet into the feed service.
